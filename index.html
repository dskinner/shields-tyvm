					Greetings citizen! SWORD powers the planetary shields and your duty as a public servant is to intonate SWORD to correct harmonics in response to foreign invasion; in addition, each incident must have a report filed with correct form identifiers!
				</p>

				<h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
				<p>Click and drag mouse on canvas; try to make displayed signal green; release mouse once green to try and lock signal in; wait for the incoming attack while signal is green, this means shields are in alignment and ready!</p>
				<p>Refresh page to start a new game! (yeah yeah ...) Note, audio can be toggled on after game is over to experiment with the last base frequency.</p>
				<p>The Y-axis controls phase modulation of duplicate signal; any value above zero will offset phase.</p>
				<p>The X-axis controls frequency modulation which may assist in reducing shield RMS values.</p>

					A browser with Wasm GC and tail call support is required to play
					this game.  We recommend using either Mozilla Firefox or Google
